# DATA 512: Human Centered Data Science (Autumn 2023)
## The Impact of Wildfires on Tulare County

## Goal
This project aims to examine the impact of wildfire smoke on Tulare County during a specific timeframe and focusing on several research questions pivotal for the county's social and economic well-being. These questions include:
1. What are the estimated smoke impacts on Tulare city for the last 60 years?
2. To what extent do certain respiratory diseases linked to smoke-related pollution (e.g., Chronic respiratory diseases, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Asthma) exhibit higher mortality rates compared to diseases not directly related to smoke-related pollution (e.g., Pneumoconiosis, Coal workers pneumoconiosis) in Tulare County from 1980 to 2014?
3. How does fire smoke relate to the age-standardized mortality rate for respiratory diseases in Tulare County across different years?
3. Is there a noticeable difference in respiratory disease mortality rates between sexes due to variations in exposure to fire smoke in Tulare County?
4. How does the prevalence of smoke fires in Tulare County connect with rates of asthma-related hospitalizations across different age groups over time?



## Motivation
The escalating frequency of summer wildfires in the western US, particularly in areas like Tulare County, CA, has spurred a critical need for comprehensive analysis and proactive measures. These wildfires, attributed to various factors such as climate change and forestry policies, have unleashed substantial smoke, adversely affecting health, tourism, property, and overall societal facets. The urgency lies in predictive health planning, which utilizes forecasts of smoke-related respiratory health trends to enact preemptive mitigation strategies. Moreover, understanding the impact of smoke on Tulare County serves as a pivotal informant for policy decisions, aiding in city planning and allocation of healthcare resources. Rising hospitalizations and mortality rates underscore the necessity for proactive measures and heightened awareness within the community. By translating extensive data into actionable policies, there's a safeguarding of the community against the respiratory risks induced by smoke. This analysis not only serves the people of Tulare County but also becomes instrumental in guiding government officials and civic institutions toward human-centered social and economic reforms. The data-driven insights and visualizations wield a significant influence, drawing the attention of policymakers, city managers, and civic institutions, facilitating informed planning to mitigate future impacts from wildfires and safeguard the lives of Tulare County residents.

## Data Sources & Descriptions

### Input Data
The following are the input data descriptions and their sources:

The common analysis research question is based on one specific dataset which can be found at [Combined wildland fire datasets for the United States and certain territories, 1800s-Present (combined wildland fire polygons)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81). This dataset was collected and aggregated by the US Geological Survey. The dataset is relatively well documented. Fire polygons are available in ArcGIS and GeoJSON formats. We have been assigned one US city that will form the basis for our individual analysis. We can find our individual US city assignment from [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cmTW5fgU3KyH6JbrRao-qWjzu2GovKk_BkA7a-poGFw/edit?usp=drive_link).

| Exclude_From_Summary_Rasters | String | Some fires in this dataset appear to be buffered circles. These were kept in the dataset to show location and approximate area. However a decision was made to exclude circular fires larger than 1 acre in size from the summary raster calculations.

2. **Mortalities from 1980 to 2014 from Respiratory Diseases in California Counties**: This dataset is in CSV format and can be downloaded from [the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) website](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-chronic-respiratory-disease-mortality-rates-county-1980-2014). The dataset is maintained and hosted by IHME. It provides us the mortalities from 1980 to 2014 from Respiratory Diseases in all California Counties. This dataset comprehensively records data on causes, years, sexes, posterior mean estimates, 2.5th percentile estimates, and 97.5th percentile estimates. It delineates the age-standardized mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 population) across different sexes and for both sexes combined, spanning the years 1980-2014 for all counties within California. Focused on Tulare County, the dataset underwent filtering using FIPS=6107, resulting in 1050 entries across 16 columns. The dataset includes both string-based descriptors (measure_name, location_name, cause_name, sex, age_name, metric) and integer-based identifiers (measure_id, location_id, FIPS, cause_id, sex_id, age_id, year_id, mx, lower, upper). It's worth noting that the dataset stands clean, devoid of any null values across all columns. The table below provides detailed descriptions of the 16 columns.

| lower | Float | 2.5% percentile estimate |
| upper | Float | 97.5% percentile estimate |

3. **Asthma Hospitalization Rates For California Counties from 2015 to 2020**: This dataset is also in CSV format and can be downloaded from [the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal (CalHHS) website](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county). The dataset is maintained and hosted by CalHHS. This comprehensive dataset encompasses counts and rates (per 10,000 residents) of asthma-related hospitalizations across all counties in California. The dataset is organized by age groups (all ages, 0-17, 18-64, 65+) and racial/ethnic categories (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan Native). Sourced from the Department of Health Care Access and Information Patient Discharge Data, the information is further refined by filtering exclusively for Tulare  County, resulting in 76 entries and 9 columns. The table below provides detailed descriptions of the 9 columns.

| NAME | DTYPE | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| _id | Integer | Unique numeric identifier for the specific entry |
| COUNTY | String | County of residence |

## Special Considerations
- Because of the large size of the "USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json" file it could not be uploaded on GitHub. Therefore to reproduce the results it is imperative to download the GeoJSON Files.zip from [this link](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) and extract the "USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json" file and place it under the data folder.
- The "all_fire_data_with_distance.csv" file is not present under the intermediate data folder because of its large size. However, if one follows the steps mentioned below to reproduce the analysis, it will be generated and no manual intervention is required.
- Fires have been filtered based on their distance from the city (maximum 1250 miles permissible) and the fire year (1963 to 2023 only)
- Since the fire date is quite messy, all fires for an year have been considered instead of just focusing on the fires between May 1st till October 31st.
- There are 35 instances of curveRings out of the 135061 instances, so we can choose to ignore them without much impact on the overall result.
- Based on the statistical outcomes and visual insights, we pursued the analysis solely focusing on Asthma, abandoning COPD due to its lack of meaningful results.
